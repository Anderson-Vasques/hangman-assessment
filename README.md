# Hangman Game

This is a simple Hangman game built with React and TypeScript as part of a technical assessment. The user interacts with the game by typing letters to guess a hidden word. The game keeps track of correct and incorrect guesses and visually represents the progress.

## ðŸ”— Live Demo

You can try the game directly in your browser via StackBlitz:

## Features

- See a list of letters theyâ€™ve guessed so far
- View underscores (`_`) representing each hidden letter
- Win the game by guessing all the correct letters
- Lose the game after 6 incorrect guesses

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
